Images, article links

4) Tree Day Signup

Process of signing up was straight forward:
- I was able to edit the address and event name after creating the event. 
- I got an email confirmation after signing up, and also creating the event. 


Some things I did notice - after entering a postcode, the dropdown generates a list of schools. If I didn't want to choose a school from the list, I couldn't set the option back to a 'blank' option. I selected the other option of 'School not Listed' and entered a school name. That school did not populate, in the 'New Planting Event' window

On the 'My Events' page, the number of Volunteers didn't match (0 volunteers), what is listed on the 'Event Details' page (5 volunteers).


I was unsure about some practical information about the event, but I ended up finding all the answers on the FAQ page. But maybe some of that information could be available in the Coordinator Hub. Maybe a Checklist or special Co-ordinator Guide, could be listed in this section.
